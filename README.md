This project is done as a part of the Odin Project Course I took from theodinproject.com

This project demonstrates the skill to use HTML tags such as the paragraph tags, italic tags, bold tags, image tags, and many more tags along with their relevant attributes. This project also demonstrate the skills to generate HTML boiler plates.
